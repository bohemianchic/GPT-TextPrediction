This project demonstrates how to use a pre-trained GPT-2 model for text prediction in an interactive notebook environment using ipywidgets. To use this notebook, you can download it and open it in a 
Jupyter notebook environment that supports interactive widgets. Execute the notebook cell to load the model and initialise the interactive input widget. Note that you may need to pip transformers, torch and
ipywidgets to run this (if you still haven't). Then, enter text into the input box labeled "Input:". As you type, the notebook will generate and display predictions based on the input text.

Results may look like:
'''
"I enjoy"
'''

Predictions will be displayed:

'''
- "reading: 0.3502"
- "writing: 0.2205"
- "watching: 0.1801"
- "playing: 0.1503"
- "learning: 0.0990"

Do whatever you want with it lol
